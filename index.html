        <p>Shrewd, educated and calculating.  Tyrion Lannister is a member of the richest and most powerful family in westeros.  He is capable of cruelty to his enemies, but also has great sympathy for fellow outcasts and the mistreated.  
        He is known for his heroics at blackwater bay, leading the defense of kings landing in it's darkest hour.</p>

        <p>Tyrion Lannister is from the amazing brook series A Song of Ice and Fire by  <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/"> George R.R. Martin</a>.  And is one of the main characters, often giving the reader a comic relief from the blood and war. </p>
